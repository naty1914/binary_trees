0x1D. C - Binary Trees

This project focuses on binary trees in the C programming language. It introduces binary trees, their structure, and the various operations thatmay be performed on them.

A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, known as the left child and the right child. It has applications in a variety of domains, including computer science and data management.

The project includes tasks that address different aspects of binary trees, such as creating nodes, inserting nodes, deleting trees, traversing trees, calculating height, checking treeÂ balance, determining common ancestors, and so on.
